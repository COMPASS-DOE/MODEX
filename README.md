# MODEX

Hi All,
Welcome to the ModEx GitHub! We will primarily use "issues" to facilitate communication between modelers and empiricists for data transfer, experiment development, publication development, etc. You can find short descriptions of each of our models here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rkuh_DK-_vIrgO1Y-d-sLJac0exxP6RTeGGy40_wXSk/edit

And a spreadsheet of all of the data that will be collected here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W-0al_QiJcW3ZSUbjzExjK_91ulhhxczNjnMxiMR4tg/edit#gid=0

Both of these documents can (and should) be updated or changed as priorities or data needs evolve.

Please feel free to start a new issue to start a discussion, add code or data, or tag someone to request info or feedback. Looking forward to developing more ModEx connections!
